# food-ordering-kiosk

## Description

1. Used Pythonâ€™s GUI package TkInter to build a system that lets consumers view the menu, order food, generate bill, and register themselves as members of the restaurant.
2. Added password-protected functionalities for the manager. As a manager, one can:
  * Create new items which would directly be displayed in the menu
  * Modify item names/rates
  * Delete items
3. Used database connectivity to store the information in relevant mySQL tables.
